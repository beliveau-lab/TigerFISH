# TigerFISH

The 3D organization of DNA within the nucleus influences key aspects of genomic functions including gene expression, epigenetic state, and DNA replication timing. However, our understanding of genome organization is incomplete, in large part because regions of the genome that contain the same repeat hundreds of times (i.e. satellite DNA) are challenging to study using sequencing-based methods. Furthermore, the organization of satellite DNA is shown to play a critical role in genome stability and in human diseases such as Huntingtonâ€™s disease and cancer. Imaging techniques are a powerful alternative to sequencing-based methods for studying genome organization by visualizing the location and distribution of genomic regions. 

Here, I propose to develop a versatile software tool (Tigerfish) that will enable single cell satellite DNA visualization using fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide (oligo) probes to better understand its role in genomic stability. Oligo probes are bioinformatically designed DNA sequences that can target DNA or RNA with high specificity for microscopy applications. I will also create resources to design Tigerfish probes against emerging genomes from long read sequencing data and established genomes for the study of satellite DNA organization in model organisms. These tools will be broadly useful for the field of genomics towards studying chromosome rearrangements and for resolving the 3D genome organization of repetitive DNA.
