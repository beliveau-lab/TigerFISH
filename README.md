# TigeRFISH Overview

TigeRFISH is a technology that enables users to design oligonucleotide FISH experiments for repetitive DNA at the genome scale. 

TigeRFISH is a scalable pipeline which identifies families of satellite DNA, designs oligo probes against these repetitive regions, and filters probes to identify probes with high specificity to regions of interest.

An interactive web tool called FISHtank contains repetitive probes designed against multiple model organisms and serves as a community resource. 

This repository contains code for the TigeRFISH pipeline.
