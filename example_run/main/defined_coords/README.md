## Main Internal Workflow: Defined Coords Test

Here, a small test region from the DXZ4 repeat derived from the chm13 v1.0 genome is provided to design repeat specific probes along with the small genomic fasta which flanks the D4Z4 and DXZ4 repeats. Links to files in these directories are summarized here:

* [config.yml](config.yml)
* [data containing .bed and .fa files for testing](data/)
* [expected output files and directories to compare](expected_pipeline_output)
* [output from pipeline run appears here](pipeline_output)
* [shell script to run pipeline](run_pipeline.sh)
