# Example Genome Assembly

These sample files serve as an example assembly to test Tigerfish. The files include only a tiny portion of repeats that exist in the chm13 v1.0 human genome assembly, and resulting probe files should be used only for software testing purposes.

The example genome sequence is contained in [example.fa](./example.fa) and repeat coordinates for the DXZ4 repeat are found in [dxz4.bed](./dxz4_synthetic.gtf).

These test files were derived from the chm13 human genome reference [here](https://github.com/marbl/CHM13). Other assemblies can be found [here](https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html).
