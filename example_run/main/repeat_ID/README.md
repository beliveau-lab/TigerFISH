## Main Internal Workflow: Defined Coords Test

Here, a genomic fasta which flanks the D4Z4 and DXZ4 repeats is provided as seperate scaffolds (chr4 and chrX) where repeats are identified by Tigerfish using the repeat identification setting. Links to files in these directories are summarized here:

* [config.yml](config.yml)
* [data containing .bed and .fa files for testing](data/)
* [expected output files and directories to compare](expected_pipeline_output)
* [output from pipeline run appears here](pipeline_output)
* [shell script to run pipeline](run_pipeline.sh)
