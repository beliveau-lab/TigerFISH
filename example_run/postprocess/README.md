## Postprocessing pipeline workflow

Here a single probe derived from the expected pipeline output of the DXZ4 repeat. To use this pipeline appropriately, please provide probes from a single scaffold at a time to preserve directory organization by scaffold. 

* [config.yml](config.yml)
* [data containing .bed and .fa files for testing](data/)
* [expected output files and directories to compare](expected_pipeline_output)
* [output from pipeline run appears here](pipeline_output)
* [shell script to run pipeline](run_pipeline.sh)
