## Main Internal Workflow

Here, a genomic fasta which flanks the D4Z4 and DXZ4 repeats is provided as seperate scaffolds (chr4 and chrX) to serve as a toy genome to test Tigerfish functionality. Here, there are three test examples as described:

1. **probe_design_test**: Here, probes are designed against the DXZ4 repeat coordinates using a reference BED file and genome FASTA reference. 

2. **repeat_discovery_test**: Here, probes are designed against both the D4Z4 and DXZ4 repeats. 

3. **probe_design_chm13**: Here, probes are designed against a full HSAT repeat on chr9 in the CHM13 genome.
