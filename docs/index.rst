Tigerfish: A tool for repetitive DNA oligonucleotide probe design
=======================================

`Tigerfish` is a user-friendly and interactive software tool that allows for the design of oligonucleotide FISH experiments specific for satellite DNA and repetitive DNA families at the scale of genomes.

Allows for de-novo repeat discovery and probe design |:microscope:|
        A pipeline that allows for repetitive probe discovery and design. Users may provide a particular region of interest for oligo probe design, or provide a genomics scaffold for repeat discovery and probe design.

Provides downstream oligo probe analyses |:bar_chart:|
        A post processing pipeline, where users may perform analysis on probes of interest to determine on and off target probe specificity in silico and generate karyoplots using ChromoMaps.

An upcoming web resource for model organisms |:tropical_fish:|
        An interactive web application for probe design that will include diverse model organism genomes containing information about relevant repetitive DNA probes for FISH experiments (FISHtank, forthcoming Q3 2022).

`Tigerfish` is intended to serve as a resource for exploring and visualizing abundantly repetitive DNA targets in genomes using oligo technology. You can find out more about features and functionality in these pages. Happy FISHing! |:fish:|
