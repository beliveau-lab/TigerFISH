Tigerfish: A tool for repetitive DNA oligonucleotide probe design
=====================================

Tigerfish is a technology and software tool that enables users to design oligonucleotide FISH experiments specific for satellite DNA and repetitive DNA families at the scale of genomes. Tigerfish is comprised of the following resources for repetitive probe design:

A pipeline that allows for repetitive probe discovery and design. Users may provide a particular region of interest for oligo probe design, or provide a genomics scaffold for repeat discovery and probe design.

A post processing pipeline, where users may perform analysis on probes of interest to determine on and off target probe specificity in silico and generate karyoplots using ChromoMaps.

An interactive web application for probe design that will include diverse model organism genomes containing information about relevant repetitive DNA probes for FISH experiments (FISHtank, forthcoming Q3 2022).

Tigerfish is intended to be a user-friendly and interactive probe design tool for exploring and visualizing abundantly repetitive DNA targets in genomes using oligo technology. You can find out more about all of Tigerfish's features in these pages.
